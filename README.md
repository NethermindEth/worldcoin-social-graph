# Public social-graph based proof of personhood

An additional layer for Worldcoin's proof of personhood. This project aims to build a social-graph-based proof of personhood that is based on World ID users,  i.e. the existing World ID users will be able to vouch for the humanness of other parties (who are not World ID users). This way, we will be able to expand the user database for World ID holders.

This project is [funded by Worldcoin](https://worldcoin.org/wave0-grant-recipients/nethermind-social-graph) (https://worldcoin.org/wave0-grant-recipients/nethermind-social-graph).

You can follow the instructions below taken from the README file of [https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template](https://github.com/worldcoin/world-id-onchain-template).

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

Create a staging on-chain app in the [Worldcoin Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).

Ensure that you have installed:
- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation)
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) (at least v16.14)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)

### Local Testnet Setup

We use 3 terminals:

**Terminal 1:**

Start a local node forked from Optimism Sepolia, replacing `$YOUR_API_KEY` with your Alchemy API key:

```bash
# leave this running in the background (we have provided a sample alchemy api key for simplicity)
anvil -f https://opt-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/$YOUR_API_KEY
# eg. anvil -f https://opt-sepolia.g.alchemy.com/v2/L-B1Qjb5675fo6DJsblLYYjlfrvCPXY9
```

**Terminal 2:**

Deploy the contract by
- Replacing `$WORLD_ID_ROUTER` with the [World ID Router address](https://docs.worldcoin.org/reference/address-book) for your selected chain

```bash
cd contracts

# Will build the contracts and output their abi in src/abi
forge build -C src/ --extra-output-files abi -o ../src/abi/

# Paste your private key generated in Terminal 1 below
forge create --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 src/Contract.sol:Contract --constructor-args 0x11cA3127182f7583EfC416a8771BD4d11Fae4334 app_staging_3cd5392cb0348670bcc22377e6090a68 verify-worldid

# Pass "Deployed to" address generated by the previous command as the constructor arg of voting contract being created below
forge create --rpc-url http://localhost:8545 --private-key 0xac0974bec39a17e36ba4a6b4d238ff944bacb478cbed5efcae784d7bf4f2ff80 src/voting.sol:Voting --constructor-args 0x97915c43511f8cB4Fbe7Ea03B96EEe940eC4AF12
```

Note the `Deployed to:` address from the output.
Set up your environment variables in the `.env` file. You will need to set the following variables:

**These have been configured, simply change the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env`**

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID`: The app ID as configured in the [Worldcoin Developer Portal](https://developer.worldcoin.org).
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ACTION`: The action ID as configured in the Worldcoin Developer Portal.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_ID`: Your WalletConnect ID.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS`: The address of the Voting contract deployed in the previous step.


**Terminal 3:**

To install project dependencies, run:

```bash
pnpm i
```

To start the development server, run:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

The Contract ABI will be automatically re-generated and saved to `src/abi/ContractAbi.json` on each run of `pnpm dev`.

### Making changes and re-deploying

After making changes to the contract, you should:

- Re-run the `forge create` command from above
- Replace the `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` environment variable with the new contract address
- If your contract ABI has changed, restart the local web server

### Testing

See the test folder [here](./contracts/test/WorldcoinSocialGraphVoting.t.sol). Run tests with forge test.

#### Note :
- When connecting your wallet to the local development environment, you will be prompted to add the network to your wallet.

- Use the [Worldcoin Simulator](https://simulator.worldcoin.org) in place of World App to scan the IDKit QR codes and generate the zero-knowledge proofs.
